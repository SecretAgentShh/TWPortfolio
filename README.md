# Technical Writing Portfolio
C'est Quoi? A collection of my work in the field of Documentation and Technical Writing.

## About Me
I am Sharon Chatragadda, a graduate of Concordia University with a degree in Software Engineering, and a Bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering from VNR VJIET. I have a strong technical background, complemented by my experience in writing. I enjoy expressing my technical thoughts through words, presentations, and diagrams. I also have experience in UX writing, UML design, and various forms of writing, ranging from academic to technical.
I would love to introduce myself as a writer whose words speak on my behalf and sometimes even more.
A humble list of my achievements would include:
* School Journalist for Nie Times of India National Newspaper for schools - 2 years
* Research enthusiast in the field of Computer Vision - 3 years
* Created user manuals and onboarding guides for a cool software company - 1 year
* Current interest in LMMs lead me to a course where I created 11 summaries and few critiques of research papers.
